# Updated-Portfolio

## About
This is a portfolio that I made for myself. In this portfolio, you will find three separate pages: one that tells you a little bit about myself, one that is an actual portfolio of all of my work and projects, and one that will set you up to email me if needed. Feel free to click the link and explore my portfolio freely. You will be able to get a sense of who I am, as well as reach out to me through numerous platforms. My Github and LinkedIn can also be found on the "About" page.
