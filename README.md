# Updated-Portfolio

## About
The objective here was to update my personal page. This was originally in another repository, but due to issues with github that led to some conflict and errors, I decided to push the updated portfolio to this new repo. 

## What's New?
For starters, the pages all received a new look on their header and footer which is uniform across all three html files. I switched the color to black as I felt it was a better contrast for the background. I made the text on the header and footer brighter, not only so it could be visible on the black background, but also to give it some pop. I added shadowing on the main containers on each page to allow them to sort of pop off the page just a little. On the portfolio page, I added images that are embedded into a href links so that you can click on the image and go directly to its corresponding project. In the html pages, I removed containers from the header and footer. I also tried to incorporate semantic tags a little bit more, most notibly on the index.html page. 

There was part of me that has considered just completely scrapping most of the previous code and starting with a blank slate, I ended up just making a few updates, but I think in the near future, I complete overhaul of the pages may be necessary.
